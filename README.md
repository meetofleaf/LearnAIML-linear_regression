# Background
This is the first repository in my journey in learning Machine Learning and AI Development. I'm a data Scientist and I want to learn Meachine Learning from scratch to cover all the basics and build a strong foundation to understand, learn and build advanced algorithms and models.
This series of repos is to learn and journal my journey, so please feel free to suggest, critique or add value in whichever way you like, I appreciate it.

# About this Repository
I'd like to start with the very basic (based on my experience), the linear regression model. you will see a basic linear regression algorithm to predict a dependant variable using an independant variable.

Feel free to suggest changes.
Happy Learning!
