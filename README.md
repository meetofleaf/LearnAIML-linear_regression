# ML Journey - Machine Learning Fundamentals' Series
Throughout this series of repositories, we'll explore various models, documenting the code and thought process behind each one.  The goal is to create a journal-like experience for both myself and anyone following along. By sharing the journey, we can:

- Break down complex concepts: We'll approach each model step-by-step, making the learning process manageable.
- Learn from mistakes: Documenting the process allows us to identify and learn from any errors along the way.
- Build a foundation: Each repository will build upon the knowledge from the previous one, creating a solid foundation in machine learning basics.
- We believe this approach can be particularly helpful for beginners struggling to find a starting point in the vast world of machine learning.

## Linear Regression - A Beginner's Guide
This repository is the first in the 'ML Journey' series aimed at revisiting fundamental machine learning models. This specific repository focuses on Linear Regression, a widely used technique for modeling linear relationships between features and a target variable.

### Data
This repository includes the dataset (student_marks.csv) suitable for linear regression.
The dataset contains 3 variables and 100 instances, uploaded by [M Yasser H](https://www.kaggle.com/yasserh).
Dataset link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/student-marks-dataset
Independent Variables: 2
- _number_courses_
- _time_study_

Dependent Variables: 1
- _Marks_

### Code
The Python code file (linear_regression.py) demonstrates how to implement linear regression using a popular machine learning library (e.g., scikit-learn). The code will be well-commented, explaining each step involved in training and using the model.

Getting Started
Clone this repository.
Ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed (refer to the code comments for details).
Run the Python script (e.g., python linear_regression.py).
Follow the comments and code execution to understand the linear regression process.
We encourage you to experiment with the code, modify the data, and play around with the model!

This is just the first step in our machine learning journey. Stay tuned for future repositories exploring other fundamental models!
